## File Structure

The data in this work is structured as follows:

```
ðŸ“¦ Dataset
â”œâ”€Â Training (A-Z)   # contains 26 folders containing training image data, one for each class 
â”œâ”€Â Testing          # contains 26 folders containing testing image data, one for each class 
â””â”€Â Letters          # contains 26 images for visualization purposes
```

## Dataset Summary


|       Name       | Number of Classes |   Images from each class   |    Size on Disk    |
|:----------------:|:-----------------:|:--------------------------:|:------------------:|
| RealSign-Dataset |         26        | ~1000 (training + testing) | ~100MB (per class) |

The RealSign folder contains 26 folders with images from each class i.e., ISL fingerspelled alphabets. 4 signers have contributed in capturing these images and have contributed equally for each class.

A sample of the dataset for ISL alphabet 'D' is given below:
